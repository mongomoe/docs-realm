Overview
--------
Listed below are some issues you might run into while setting up a Realm {+app+}
with React Native and solutions to those issues. Check out the :doc:`Getting Help </get-started/getting-help>` page 
if you are running into issues that aren't listed here or need additional help.

Chrome Debugging is slow
------------------------
We are aware of this. The reason for this is that since Realm is written in C++
and runs native code, it has to run on the device/simulator. But given the
zero-copy architecture, we need to send values in realm objects over the RPC
wire every time you inspect an object that is stored in a Realm. We are
investigating various potential solutions for this problem. If you want to keep
track of it, you can follow the GitHub issue.


Crash Reporting
---------------
We encourage you to use a crash reporter in your application. Many Realm
operations could potentially fail at runtime (like any other disk IO), so
collecting crash reports from your application will help identify areas where
either you (or us) can improve error handling and fix crashing bugs. Most
commercial crash reporters have the option of collecting logs. We strongly
encourage you to enable this feature. Realm logs metadata information (but no
user data) when throwing exceptions and in irrecoverable situations, and these
messages can help debug when things go wrong.
